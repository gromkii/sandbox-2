## Thought Process

While the challenge was originally presented as a fairly straight forward task, I really
wanted to push myself to try to make a small application in React with scalability in
mind. This was my first attempt at really making a single page app with React, and in
doing so I have learned a lot about the framework and I am excited to work on more
projects with it in the future.

## Challenges

Having to learn React in such a short amount of time was my main obstacle to overcome
for this project. The biggest take away from doing all of this was how to store
information in a react components state, especially from AJAX calls to an API.
